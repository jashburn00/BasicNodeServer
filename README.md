# BasicNodeServer
A basic implementation of a live chat server (with some other random functions) intended for me to learn and illustrate Node servers and web sockets. 

*The code in this branch is meant to be run locally, on one machine.*

## How To Use
1. navigate (from the root directory) to the 'src' folder and use Node to run server.js
    - e.g. <br>`cd src`<br>`node server.js`
2. then, navigate back to the root directory of the cloned project in your terminal and use Node to run the client.js file. <br>*Do this with a different terminal window so you don't have to close the server!*
    - e.g. <br>`cd ..`<br>`node client.js`

## System Requirements
- Node installed
- mocha installed

## Developer TODO list
- Give users the option to deny a chat connection
- create test suite
